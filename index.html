     First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls,
     but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows,
     ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.

    <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts with
       the parkâ€™s ecosystems. This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for <b>current fire restrictions.
    </b>

      We strongly recommend that you make reservations for lodging, camping, and backpacking. You can pay the <b> park entrance fee</b> upon arrival (there's no need to pay it in advance).
